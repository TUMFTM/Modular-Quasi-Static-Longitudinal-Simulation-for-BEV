Structure of the saved cycles:

The cycles variables contain three elements:

t: The cycle time in s
v: The cycle speed in km/h
S: The slope (if present) in %

Ths slope expresses the inclination/ramp angle 
at each timestep of the cycle. In most cases it 
is a vector of zeros, since conventional cycles 
usually do not have any slope.
