% Description: %This function is only a dummy function to find the path of the motor characteristics
%               DO NOT DELETE AND DO NOT MOVE
% ------------
% Input: v: The vehicle structure -> Stores the calculated component volumes and masses
%        Par: The Parameters structure -> Stores the constant values and regressions for volume and mass models
% ------------
% Output: The vehicle struct with filled MOTOR and GEARBOX fields, according to the choosen topology
